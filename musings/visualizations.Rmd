NOTE: This is intentionally placed in `musings` as it is still a draft.

Good visualizations help the user understand what is going on. One may use
`plot.covidcast_signal` from the `covidcast` package to plot US maps, including
county maps. However, `covidcast` will not support maps unrelated to the US.
One may use `plot` and `ggplot` for various plots
including scatterplots. Finally, users can add animation and interactive
features on the plot.

`epipredict` supports visualizations features that are a part of COVIDcast.
However, it is not intended for
those who use third-party data visualization software such as Power BI and
Tableau. Despite that, visualizations go alongside cmu-delphi's covidcast
library.
